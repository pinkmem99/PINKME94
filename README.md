## :link: Shorten your url

When you want to share a url about facebook-post or twitter-post or news-post, etc, generally the url you are providing is very large.
Large URLs looks ugly compared to short urls. So, if you want some URL to post on your website, or want send it to someone special, shorten them first. Websites you shortned on this website, lives here permanantly, short-custom-url once used would never again be used for another site, so you don't need to worry about wrong redirection of link in future.

## :link: System-Design

- NextJS is used as frontend and backend for the site
- PostgreSQL is used as a database for storage of custom/short-urls and their long-urls
